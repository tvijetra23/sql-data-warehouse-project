## 🌟 About Me

Hey there! 👋 I’m Tanishka Vijetra — part analyst, part data detective, and full-time fan of turning chaos into clarity. I built this project to show how raw, messy CSV files can be transformed into sleek, business-ready dashboards… kind of like giving data a spa day 🧖‍♀️📊.

💬 A little about me:
- 🛠 I love designing data pipelines that actually *work* — no duct tape involved.
- 📦 I believe in the power of good data models (Star Schema = ⭐️ of my heart).
- 📈 My happy place is writing SQL queries that answer the unspoken business question.
- 🎯 I enjoy finding hidden patterns, weird anomalies, and “aha!” insights in datasets.
